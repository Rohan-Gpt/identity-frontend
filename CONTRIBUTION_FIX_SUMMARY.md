# Contribution Calendar Real-time Update Fix

## Problem Summary
When users added a platform for the first time, the contribution calendar did not update immediately to show the latest data. Users had to reload the page to see their updated contribution calendar.

## Root Cause
The `ProfileView.tsx` component was managing its own contribution state and WebSocket connection separately from the dedicated `useContributionData` hook, causing a disconnect between real-time updates and UI rendering.

## Solution
1. **Refactored ProfileView.tsx** to use the `useContributionData` hook instead of managing its own state
2. **Removed duplicate WebSocket logic** from ProfileView.tsx 
3. **Fixed useContributionData hook** dependency issues
4. **Added missing type definitions** for proper TypeScript compilation

## Changes Made

### Before:
```typescript
// ProfileView.tsx had its own contribution state
const [contributions, setContributions] = useState(initialData?.data?.contributions ?? []);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

// And its own WebSocket connection
useEffect(() => {
  const ws = new WebSocket(WEBSOCKET_URL);
  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    // Handle messages independently
    debouncedRefetch();
  };
}, [debouncedRefetch]);
```

### After:
```typescript
// ProfileView.tsx now uses the dedicated hook
const { contributions, isLoading, error } = useContributionData(
  initialData?.data?.contributions ?? []
);
// WebSocket handling is centralized in the hook
```

## Result
- ✅ Contribution calendar updates immediately when new platform data is received
- ✅ No more page reloads required
- ✅ Centralized state management
- ✅ Reduced code duplication by ~50 lines
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

## Flow After Fix
1. User adds new platform → Backend processes → WebSocket sends `contributions_updated`
2. `useContributionData` hook receives message → Triggers `fetchContributions()`
3. Fresh data fetched → `setContributions(freshData)` updates state
4. ProfileView re-renders with new data → Calendar updates immediately

The fix ensures real-time synchronization between backend data changes and frontend UI updates.
